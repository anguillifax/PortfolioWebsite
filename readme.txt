A reminder on academic integrity, as described in the syllabus.

In general, the course staff expects that you will look at code and examples from many online resources as part of the assignments, particularly to resolve syntax and understand frameworks. We expect that you'll use other libraries you find, and will even require it in some assignments. These practices are often critical to the work of developers today. The best developers are adept at interpreting the examples they see, customizing them to their specific situation, and citing their sources so they can find them later. We expect you to do the same.

While learning from examples is encouraged, attempting to pass an existing project or example from the web as your own is not allowed. If you ever have a question about what is or is not appropriate, feel free to ask the course staff!

Talking to classmates about class material, assignment requirements, etc. is a great way to verify ideas and get feedback. But this distinctly does *not* permit attempting to pass off someone elseâ€™s code as your own. Talking over ideas and approaches is allowed, but the work that you produce and submit must be your own.

1. How many assignment points do you believe you completed (replace the *'s with your numbers)?

15/15
- 1/1 Readme
- 3/3 Basic HTML content
- 3/3 Basic CSS styling
- 2/2 Advanced feature
- 3/3 Responsive layout
- 1/1 Passes validation checks
- 2/2 Embraces spirit of the assignment

2. What (a) basic features, (b) CSS features, and (c) advanced features did you include in your portfolio?

(a) Basic features

I added 4 pages of content, hyperlinks and navigation between pages, and rich
image/text multimedia on each page. All page text and layout was custom designed
for this class, and was not reused from any previous material. All images
contain succinct alt-text.

(b) CSS features

Custom navbar that leverages `position` attribute and opens/collapses in mobile
mode. Consistent mobile-first design philosophy with reflow and resizing for
devices >600px. Padding, alignment, and sizing for all page elements, with
use of CSS `var()` for inter-page consistency.

All CSS is built 100% by hand, using no web frameworks as shortcuts.

(c) Advanced features

- Advanced CSS selectors spread across multiple CSS files.
- Global color and font variables for consistent look/feel.
- Customized floating elements and flexbox containers for advanced content flow.
- Embedded iframe content on my Projects page.
- Videos on my home page.
- Consistent and focused goal to maximize usability on all elements.

3. How long, in hours, did it take you to complete this assignment?

I believe this website took me 16 hours to build. I spent 2 hours planning and
sketching (see `Mockup.png`). I spent 4 hours reading about CSS, Flexboxes, HTML
tags, and responsive design. And the remaining 10 hours were spent writing,
fixing, and iterating on the website design.

4. What online resources did you consult when completing this assignment? (list specific URLs)

I used W3C's HTML/CSS references extensively to learn tag behavior and view
examples.
https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp
https://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp

In particular, I referenced their navbar example closely to build my own.
https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_navbar.asp

In addition, I referenced the Udemy course on basic webdev for many of the minor
tricks I've used throughout. This include the universal selector for clearing
margin, padding, and setting box-sizing.

5. What classmates or other individuals did you consult as part of this assignment? What did you discuss?

I consulted an online web developer friend for tips on how to organize my
html/css/resources into folders. He linked me to an example website, but all
final decisions were my own.

6. Is there anything special we need to know in order to run your code?

No. Although the site may be accessed live on GitHub!
